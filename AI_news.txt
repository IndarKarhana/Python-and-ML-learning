Judge Blocks AI-Enhanced Video Evidence in Groundbreaking Ruling - https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/washington-state-judge-blocks-use-ai-enhanced-video-evidence-rcna141932
In a potential first-of-its-kind ruling, a Washington state judge barred the use of AI-enhanced video evidence in a triple murder case, citing concerns over the technology's "opaque methods" and lack of peer review. The ruling highlights legal challenges as AI rapidly evolves, with the judge stating its admission could lead to confusion and a "trial within a trial" about the AI model's process.

Weighing Risks and Benefits of Personalizing LLMs - https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-personalization-potential-democratize-llms.html
Personalizing large language models could democratize whose views shape the AI by increasing inclusivity. Potential benefits include formatting tailored to user preferences and greater productivity. However, risks highlighted by researchers include privacy violations, over-attachment, worsening digital divides, societal polarization into echo chambers, and enabling sophisticated disinformation campaigns. They urge proactively addressing these potential downsides as personalization capabilities rapidly develop.

US AIrforce confirms first successful AI dogfight - https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133870/us-air-force-ai-dogfight-test-x-62a?ref=futuretools.io
In a milestone for AI in aviation, the US Air Force has confirmed the first successful dogfight between an AI-controlled jet and a human pilot. As part of DARPA's ACE program, an unmanned X-62A aircraft autonomously fought an F-16 last September, demonstrating maneuvers like high-speed close passes. While pilots could disable the AI for safety, they didn't need to intervene during the test dogfight.

Google will provide AI to the military for disaster response - https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/17/google-x-bellwether-national-guard-disasters/?ref=futuretools.io
Google has partnered with the US National Guard to provide artificial intelligence tools that can rapidly analyze aerial imagery after disasters. The AI from Google's Bellwether group can ingest photos, compare them to maps, and automatically identify damaged locations, roads and infrastructure in seconds instead of days. This will allow the National Guard to more quickly direct resources for responding to wildfires, floods, and other climate change-driven disasters they increasingly face.
