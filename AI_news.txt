Computer vision accelerates surveillance analysis, posing privacy concerns. UCF researchers develop software funded by NSF ART to obscure faces and details in real time. Targeting edge devices, emphasis on speed and efficiency. Work expands CRCV's efforts, addressing privacy in surveillance while enhancing society's navigation through computer vision.

AI to Autonomously Design New Drugs Soon - https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/05/within-a-few-years-generative-ai-will-design-new-drugs-on-its-own.html
Major pharmaceutical companies use generative AI to rapidly design new drug molecules at unprecedented scale. AI generates as many designs in minutes as traditional labs in a year. Surprisingly, some AI-generated "weird" molecular structures showed potential as drugs, opening new creative pathways. Executives believe AI will autonomously generate new medicines soon, reshaping drug discovery and scientific methods. A pivotal moment was when AI could predict protein structures from amino acids, key for drug development.

Generative AI: Unleashing or Undermining Human Creativity? - https://news.uga.edu/generative-ai-and-creativity/
As artificial intelligence progresses, the dialogue surrounding AI and creativity grows nuanced. Is creativity something computable, innate, or a blend? Research ties creativity to memory, proposing that semantic memory, our repository of foundational knowledge, fuels imagination. AI tools also boast semantic memory, raising questions about their impact on creativity. Despite AI's role in creative tasks, maintaining human creativity remains essential.

Enhancing AI and Image Processing Security through Verification Techniques - https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-verification-techniques-ai-image.html
Researchers have developed a novel framework that improves the efficiency and practicality of verifiable computing, enabling unforgeable guarantees of correct data processing. The modular approach combines the performance advantages of custom solutions with the versatility of general-purpose proof systems. It demonstrates practical applications in artificial intelligence and image processing, enhancing integrity, fairness, and privacy in outsourced data processing tasks.

California Faces Huge Grid Overhaul for Coming EV Demand - https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317599121
A study analyzed California's power grid capacity against projected electric vehicle (EV) demand, revealing the state needs massive upgrades. To meet the ban on new gas cars by 2035, California must increase overall grid capacity by 25%, potentially costing $20 billion. Around 67% of distribution circuits require upgrades by 2045. Residential areas need double the power increase compared to commercial zones. The analysis highlights the substantial grid overhaul required globally to transition to EVs.
