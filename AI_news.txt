Commerce Department's Moves to Fulfill Biden's AI Order - https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2024/04/department-commerce-announces-new-actions-implement-president-bidens
The U.S. Department of Commerce announced new measures in response to President Biden's Executive Order on AI, including draft publications from NIST addressing AI safety and transparency and a USPTO request for public feedback on AI's impact on patent evaluations. These initiatives aim to foster responsible AI innovation and safeguard intellectual property.

Language Models' Limitations in Motivation Recognition and Behavior Change Support - https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/1380509577?utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=hckscscil&utm_source=nb
Large language model-based chatbots show promise in supporting behaviour change when users are committed to action. However, they struggle to recognize early motivational stages, hindering effective guidance. Researchers found these models fail to address resistance to change effectively but provide adequate support for those actively pursuing behaviour change. Future studies aim to enhance models' understanding of motivation.

Animal-Inspired AI: Revolutionizing Autonomous Robotics - https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2024/tu-delft/animal-brain-inspired-ai-game-changer-for-autonomous-robots
Scientists are exploring neuromorphic processors inspired by animal brains, offering faster and more energy-efficient alternatives to traditional deep neural networks. Spiking neural networks, mimicking the brain's asynchronous processing, show promise for autonomous robots. Delft University researchers demonstrate a drone using neuromorphic vision and control, marking a significant advancement in robotics.

Machine Listening: Advancing Inclusive Speech Recognition - https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/machine-listening-making-speech-recognition-systems-more-inclusive/
Voice technology, such as virtual assistants, can enhance efficiency, but errors in speech recognition persist. Research highlights disparities in understanding technology-directed speech, especially among African American English speakers. By studying speaker adaptations when interacting with voice assistants, researchers aim to address linguistic discrimination and promote inclusivity in technology.

Game Theory Strategies for Language Model Reliability - https://news.mit.edu/2024/consensus-game-elevates-ai-text-comprehension-generation-skills-0514
MIT researchers have developed a "consensus game" inspired by cryptic communication games to enhance AI's understanding and generation of text. By treating AI interaction as a game where parts cooperate under specific rules, they significantly improve text generation across tasks like reading comprehension and dialogue. This innovative approach bridges disparities in existing methods and shows promise for future language models.
